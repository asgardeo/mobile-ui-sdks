# Start the Authentication Process

1. Initialize the SDK object `AsgardeoAuth`, to authenticate users into your application. This can be done in a repository if you are using an [MVVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/) pattern in your application.

    ```kotlin
    private val asgardeoAuth: AsgardeoAuth = AsgardeoAuth.getInstance(
        AuthenticationCoreConfig(
            discoveryEndpoint = "https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org_name>/oauth2/token/.well-known/openid-configuration",
            authnEndpoint = "https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org_name>/oauth2/authn",
            redirectUri = "wso2.apiauth.sample.android://oauth2",
            clientId = "<client_id>",
            scope = "openid profile email"
        )
    )
    ```
    <a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.core_config/-authentication-core-config/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticationCoreConfig</a> holds the configuration details that are required to set up the communication between the SDK and the Asgardeo.

2. Get the <a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.provider.providers.authentication/-authentication-provider/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticationProvider</a> from the created `AsgardeoAuth` instance. This will assist you in handling the authentication process.

```kotlin
val authenticationProvider: AuthenticationProvider = asgardeoAuth.getAuthenticationProvider()
```

<a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.provider.providers.authentication/-authentication-provider/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticationProvider</a> handles the authentication process using [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow#stateflow). This will help you to handle each state of the authentication process easily. There are four states in the authentication process (<a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.models.state/-authentication-state/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticationState</a>):

- **AuthenticationState.Initial**: Initial state of the authentication process.
- **AuthenticationState.Loading**: SDK is calling an API to handle the authentication and waiting for the result.
- **AuthenticationState.Unauthenticated**: This means the authentication flow is still not completed and a particular step is getting challenged for authentication. In this state, the list of available authenticators will be returned to you in a 
<a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.models.authentication_flow/-authentication-flow-not-success/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticationFlowNotSuccess</a> object.
- **AuthenticationState.Authenticated**: User is authenticated.
- **AuthenticationState.Error**: An error occurred during the authentication flow.

3. To start the authentication process, call `authenticationProvider.getAuthenticationStateFlow`, this will act as the observer for the authentication state changes.

```kotlin
val authenticationStateFlow = authenticationProvider.getAuthenticationStateFlow()
```

After that, you can call `authenticationProvider.isLoggedInStateFlow`, this will check if there is an active session available, and if available, the authentication state will emit **AuthenticationState.Authenticated**, else will emit **AuthenticationState.Initial**. 

Then call the `authenticationProvider.initializeAuthentication` to initialize the authentication process when the state is **AuthenticationState.Initial**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the suspend functions should be called inside a coroutine scope. Suspended functions in the SDK are designed to be optimized for `Dispatchers.IO` context.

```kotlin
@Composable
internal fun LandingScreen() {
    val context: Context = LocalContext.current
    val authenticationStateFlow = authenticationProvider.getAuthenticationStateFlow()

    IsLoggedInStateFlow(context)
    HandleAuthenticationState(authenticationStateFlow, context)
}

@Composable
private fun IsLoggedInStateFlow(context: Context) {
    LaunchedEffect(key1 = Unit) {
        GlobalScope.launch {
            authenticationProvider.isLoggedInStateFlow(context)
        }
    }
}

@Composable
private fun HandleAuthenticationState(authenticationStateFlow: StateFlow<AuthenticationState>) {
    LaunchedEffect(key1 = Unit) {
        GlobalScope.launch {
            authenticationStateFlow.collect {
                when (it) {
                    is AuthenticationState.Initial -> {
                        // pre /authorize
                        authenticationProvider.initializeAuthentication(context)  // [!code highlight]
                    }
                    is AuthenticationState.Unauthenticated -> {
                       /** 
                        * Gets called when /authorize and /authn responds with an “INCOMPLETE” state. 
                        * This means authentication flow is still not completed and a particular step is getting
                        * challenged for authentication.
                        */
                        LoginForm(it.authenticationFlow)
                    }
                    is AuthenticationState.Error -> {
                       /** 
                        * Gets called when /authorize and /authn responds with an “FAIL_INCOMPLETE” state 
                        * which responds at an error of a particular authentication step
                        */
                    }
                    is AuthenticationState.Authenticated -> {
                       /** 
                        * Gets called when /authn responds with an “SUCCESS” state. This means 
                        * authentication flow is completed
                        */

                        onSuccessfulLogin()
                    }
                    is AuthenticationState.Loading -> {
                        // Show loading
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot directly use Composable functions inside a coroutine, above its used to show the flow of the application. The best approach you can take is to use [navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation).

Assuming that you have configured Username and Password as the first authentication step and TOTP as the second step, you can develop the UI as follows using the <a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.models.autheniticator/-authenticator-types/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticatorTypes</a> provided by the SDK to populate the login form.
```kotlin
/**
 * Assuming the authentication process is, basic as first factor and TOTP as second factor
 */
@Composable
internal fun LoginForm(
    authenticationFlow: AuthenticationFlowNotSuccess,
    onSuccessfulLogin: (User) -> Unit
) {
    authenticationFlow.nextStep.authenticators.forEach {
        when (it.authenticator) {
            AuthenticatorTypes.BASIC_AUTHENTICATOR.authenticatorType -> { // [!code highlight]
                BasicAuth(authenticator = it)
            }

            AuthenticatorTypes.TOTP_AUTHENTICATOR.authenticatorType -> { // [!code highlight]
                TotpAuth(authenticator = it)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the BasicAuth component you can call the authentication function provided by the <a href="/mobile-ui-sdks/android/api/core-auth-direct/io.asgardeo.android.core_auth_direct.provider.providers.authentication/-authentication-provider/index.html" target="_blank">AuthenticationProvider</a> to authenticate with username and password. Similarly, this can be done in other components as well.
```kotlin
@Composable
internal fun BasicAuth(authenticator: Authenticator) {
    BasicAuthComponent(
        onLoginClick = { username, password ->
            GlobalScope.launch {
                authenticationProvider.authenticateWithUsernameAndPassword(
                    context = context,
                    authenticatorId = authenticator.authenticatorId,
                    username = username,
                    password = password
                )
            }
        }
    )
}

@Composable
fun BasicAuthComponent(
    onLoginClick: (username: String, password: String) -> Unit
) {
    Column() {
        var username by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
        var password by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

        OutlinedTextField(
            value = username,
            onValueChange = { username = it },
            label = { Text(text = "Username") }
        )
        OutlinedTextField(
            value = password,
            onValueChange = { password = it },
            visualTransformation = PasswordVisualTransformation(),
            label = { Text(text = "Password") }
        )
        Button(onClick = { onLoginClick(username, password) }) {
            Text(text = "Login")
        }
    }
}
```

You will not need to handle the authentication state in multiple places, you can do it at the start of the application, and it will handle the state accordingly.

> [!CAUTION]
> When using `GlobalScope`, make sure to cancel the coroutine when the composable is removed from the screen. This is to avoid memory leaks.
> Also instead of using `GlobalScope`, you can use `viewModelScope` if you are using the MVVM pattern in your application.
> For more information on how to handle coroutines in Jetpack Compose, see [the following documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-global-scope/).
